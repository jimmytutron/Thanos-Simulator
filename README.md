 In time, you will know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail, all the same. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives.

 This is a full stack web app harnessing the powers of the infinity stones... just kidding... Harnessing the powers of Node, Express and Handlebars. Using a MVC design pattern, this app integrates a MySQL database to query and route data and uses Handlebars to generate HTML content.

A huuuuge thanks to my classmates, espeically Robert, Eric, and Nick for helping me when I was confused.

Marvel... that ending was not cool tbh but Thanos was the best baddie and I'm eagerly awaiting the next Avengers movie.
